## My journey as a Linux user

- Early days: **Slackware**, **RedHat**, **Fedora**, ...
- Former **Gentoo** user
- I experimented with SSH/GPG **agents isolation** using different users accounts
- My work PC needed to be replaced
- Seduced by the ideas of **stateless machines**, wiping changes not committed to the templates and **context isolation**
- Let’s give it a try, I could still go back in case it doesn’t work for me

## Why this workshop

- You learn a lot by **doing/teaching/presenting**
- But you also learn a lot by looking at **what other people do**
- Lets make a deal, I’ll show you **my tricks**, you’ll show me **yours**
